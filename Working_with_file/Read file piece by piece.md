###How To Read Files Piece by Piece
The easiest way to read a file in chunks is to use a loop. First we will learn how to read a file line by line and then we will learn how to read it a kilobyte at a time. We will use a for loop for our first example:
```python
handle = open("test.txt", "r")

for line in handle:
    print(line)

handle.close()
```
**output**
```
This is a test file

line 2

line 3

this line intentionally left blank
```
Here we open up a read-only file handle and then we use a for loop to iterate over it. You will find that you can iterate over all kinds of objects in Python (strings, lists, tuples, keys in a dictionary, etc). That was pretty simple, right? Now let’s do it in chunks!

```python
handle = open("test.txt", "r")

while True:
    data = handle.read(1024)
    print(data)
    if not data:
        break
 ```
 **output**
 ```
 This is a test file
line 2
line 3
this line intentionally left blank
```
In this example, we use Python’s while loop to read a kilobyte of the file at a time. As you probably know, a kilobyte is 1024 bytes or characters. Now let’s pretend that we want to read a binary file, like a PDF.

###How to Read a Binary File
Reading a binary file is very easy. All you need to do is change the file mode:
```python
handle = open("test.pdf", "rb")
```
So this time we changed the file mode to rb, which means read-binary. You will find that you may need to read binary files when you download PDFs from the internet or transfer files from PC to PC
