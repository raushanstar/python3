# Functions

A function is a structure that you define. You get to decide if they have arguments or not. You can add keyword arguments and default arguments too. A function is a block of code that starts with the **def** keyword, a name for the function and a colon. Here’s a simple example:
```python
def a_function():
    print("You just created a function!")
```
This function doesn’t do anything except print out some text. To call a function, you need to type out the name of the function followed by an open and close parentheses:

```python
def a_function():
    print("You just created a function!")
a_function()
```
**output**
```
You just created a function!
```
Simple, eh?

# An Empty Function (the stub)
Sometimes when you are writing out some code, you just want to write the function definitions without putting any code in them. I’ve done this as kind of an outline. It helps you to see how your application is going to be laid out. Here’s an example:

```python
def empty_function():
    pass
```
Here’s something new: the **pass** statement. It is basically a null operation, which means that when **pass** is executed, nothing happens.
