# Using from to import

Some people don’t like having to preface everything they type with the module name. Python has a solution for that! You can actually import just the functions you want from a module. Let’s pretend that we want to just import the **sqrt** function:

```python
from math import sqrt
print(sqrt(16)) # 4.0
```
***OUTPUT***
```
4.0

```
This works pretty much exactly how it is read: **from the math module, import the sqrt function**. Let me explain it another way. We use Python’s **from** keyword to import the **sqrt** function **from** the math module. You can also use this method to import multiple functions from the math function:
```python
from math import pi, sqrt
```
In this example, we import both **pi and sqrt**. If you tried to access **pi** you may have noticed that it’s actually a value and not a function that you can call. It just returns the value of pi. When you do an import, you may end up importing a value, a function or even another module! There’s one more way to import stuff that we need to cover. Let’s find out how to import everything!
